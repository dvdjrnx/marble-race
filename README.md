# Marble Race

![A purple marble sits at the beginning of a race track filled with moving red obstacles. The words "Marble Race" appear beside the marble. There's an unstarted timer that appears above the marble and a simplistic display of arrow or WASD keys and a space bar below.](./public/marble-race.jpg)

This project brings together many concepts of working with Three.js and React Three Fiber to create an in-browser game controlled by a keyboard.

It features a marble that can be directed via arrow and WASD keys. It can also jump with the space bar. The goal is to move as quickly as possible down a track with multiple, randomized obstacles.

When you first move, a timer begins. Upon reaching the end of the track, the timer stops and shows you your time. You can then restart to beat your previous record.

The work was undertaken as one of many steps in acquiring [my Three.js certification](https://threejs-journey.com/certificate/view/24741) through [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/).
